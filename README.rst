===============

Examples of illustrative iPython (Jupyter) notebooks for those trying to learn
Python.

for get started in Jupyter, please see
`Getting Started in Jupyter for Python article <http://josephcslater.github.io/jupyter-quick-start.html>`_.

These are nominally notes to myself for easy reference. Perhaps you will
find them helpful too. Your feedback is appreciated. Please also look
at other demonstrations on `my blog <http:josephcslater.github.io>`_.
